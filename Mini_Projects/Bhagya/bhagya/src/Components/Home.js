                <p>Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer over 11 years ago, 
                    I've done remote work for agencies,<br/> consulted for startups,
                    and collaborated with talented people to create digital products 
                    <br/>for both business and consumer use.I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and
                     <br/>perpetually working on improving my chops one design problem at a time.</p>
